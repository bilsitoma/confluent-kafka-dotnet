Monster Crown was released in early access on Steam on July 31, 2020[^1^], and has received mostly positive reviews from players who praised its gameplay, depth, customization and difficulty. The game is developed by Studio Aurum, an indie team of passionate monster taming fans who wanted to create a game that pays homage to the genre while also adding their own twist. The game is inspired by games like Pokemon, Dragon Quest Monsters, Shin Megami Tensei and Monster Rancher.
 
Monster Crown is not your typical monster taming game. It has a darker tone and a more complex story than most games in the genre. The game features multiple endings and branching paths depending on your actions and alliances. You can choose to side with different factions and characters, each with their own motives and agendas. You can also influence the personality and loyalty of your monsters by how you treat them. Some monsters might betray you or rebel against you if you are not careful.
 
Monster Crown also has a robust breeding system that allows you to create new monsters by combining the genes of two parents. You can customize the appearance, stats, moves and traits of your offspring, creating endless possibilities. You can also trade your monsters online with other players or challenge them to battles in the multiplayer mode. The game has a large and diverse world to explore, with different regions, biomes, secrets and mysteries. You can also find rare and legendary monsters that are hidden or require special conditions to encounter.
 
Monster Crown is a game that will appeal to both casual and hardcore fans of monster taming games. It has a lot of content and features to offer, and it is constantly being updated by the developers who listen to the feedback of the community. The game is expected to leave early access in late 2021 or early 2022, with more content and improvements planned for the full release. If you are looking for a game that will challenge you and immerse you in a dark and engaging world of monsters, you should give Monster Crown a try.
  
## How to Play Monster Crown
 
Monster Crown is a game that requires strategy and planning. You can have up to five monsters in your party, and you can switch them during battles. Each monster has four moves that they can use, and each move has a type, power, accuracy and cooldown. The type of the move determines its effectiveness against different types of monsters. There are 18 types in the game, and each type has its own strengths and weaknesses. You can also use items to heal, boost or protect your monsters.
 
To tame a monster, you need to weaken it in battle and then offer it a pact. The pact is a contract that binds the monster to you, but it also gives the monster some rights and conditions. For example, some monsters might demand a share of your money or items, or they might refuse to fight certain enemies. You can also break a pact if you want to release a monster or trade it with another player. However, breaking a pact will lower your reputation and trust with other monsters.
 
To breed a monster, you need to have two compatible monsters of the same species or genus. You can take them to a breeder who will create an egg for you. The egg will hatch into a new monster that inherits the traits of its parents. You can also use a special item called a Crown to fuse two monsters of different species or genus. The result will be a hybrid monster that has a unique appearance and abilities. However, fusing monsters is risky and irreversible, so you should be careful when doing it.
  
## What Makes Monster Crown Different
 
Monster Crown is a game that stands out from other monster taming games for several reasons. One of them is its dark and mature story that deals with themes like oppression, rebellion, corruption and morality. The game does not shy away from showing the consequences of your actions and the impact they have on the world and the characters. You will encounter situations where you have to make tough choices that will affect the outcome of the story and the fate of Crown Island.

Another reason is its deep and complex breeding system that allows you to create your own unique monsters. You can customize every aspect of your monsters, from their appearance to their moves and traits. You can also experiment with different combinations and see what results you get. You can create powerful hybrids that can dominate the battles, or you can create cute and quirky monsters that will make you smile. The possibilities are endless.
 
A third reason is its challenging and rewarding gameplay that will test your skills and knowledge. The game does not hold your hand or guide you through everything. You have to explore the world on your own and discover its secrets and mysteries. You have to learn the strengths and weaknesses of each type of monster and use them to your advantage. You have to manage your resources and items wisely and be prepared for any situation. The game will challenge you with tough enemies and bosses that will require strategy and tactics to defeat.
