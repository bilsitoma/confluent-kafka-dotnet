## Step 3: Choose a password attack method and set the parameters
 
iSunshare ZIP Password Genius offers four password attack methods for you to choose from: Brute-force, Mask, Dictionary and Smart. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the complexity and length of your zip password. You can choose the most suitable method according to your situation and set the parameters accordingly.
 
- Brute-force: This method will try all possible combinations of characters until it finds the correct password. It is the most effective but also the most time-consuming method. You can specify the character range, such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and symbols, and the password length range.
- Mask: This method is similar to Brute-force, but it allows you to provide some clues about your password, such as the first or last character, or some known characters in a certain position. This can reduce the search space and speed up the recovery process. You can use "?" to replace any unknown character in your password.
- Dictionary: This method will try all the words in a predefined or customized dictionary file until it finds the correct password. It is faster than Brute-force but less effective if your password is not a common word or phrase. You can use the default dictionary file provided by iSunshare ZIP Password Genius or create your own dictionary file with your frequently used words or phrases.
- Smart: This method will try some intelligent strategies based on the characteristics of your zip file and password. It is faster than Brute-force but less effective than Mask or Dictionary. You don't need to set any parameters for this method.

## Step 4: Start to recover zip password
 
After choosing a password attack method and setting the parameters, you can click on the "Start" button to begin the recovery process. You can see the progress bar, the estimated time remaining, and the current password being tried on the screen. You can also pause or stop the recovery process at any time by clicking on the "Stop" button.
 
## Step 5: Copy and use the recovered zip password
