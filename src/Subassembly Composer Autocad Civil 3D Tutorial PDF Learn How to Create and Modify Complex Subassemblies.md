Subassembly Composer is a tool that allows you to create and customize complex subassemblies for corridor modeling in Autodesk Civil 3D. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Subassembly Composer to create a subassembly project, define geometry elements and parameters, preview and verify the subassembly behavior, and import the subassembly into Civil 3D.

## Creating a Subassembly Project
 
To create a subassembly project, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Subassembly Composer from the Windows Start menu or from the Autodesk Civil 3D menu bar.
2. Click File > New to create a new project.
3. In the Settings and Parameters panel, enter the following information for your subassembly:
    - Subassembly Name: The name that will be seen within Civil 3D once youâve imported the subassembly. The name must begin with one letter character and be followed by one or more letters, numbers and/or underline characters[^3^].
    - Description: A brief description of what the subassembly does or how it is used. This will be shown when you hover the mouse over the subassembly in the tool palette.
    - Author: Your name or organization.
    - Help URL: An optional link to a web page or document that provides more information or instructions about the subassembly.
    - Input Parameters: The values that can be entered by the user when inserting the subassembly in Civil 3D. You can add, edit, or delete input parameters as needed.
    - Output Parameters: The values that are calculated by the subassembly and can be used by other subassemblies or components in Civil 3D. You can add, edit, or delete output parameters as needed.

## Defining Geometry Elements and Parameters
 
To define the geometry elements and parameters of your subassembly, follow these steps:

1. In the Tool Box panel, select a geometry element from one of the categories (Points, Links, Shapes, Advanced Geometry, Auxiliary Geometry, Marked Points, Targets, Variables, Expressions, or API Functions).
2. Drag and drop the geometry element onto the Flowchart panel. The Flowchart panel shows the logic and sequence of your subassembly elements.
3. In the Properties panel, enter or modify the properties of the geometry element. You can use input parameters, output parameters, variables, expressions, or API functions to define or calculate property values.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each geometry element you want to add to your subassembly. You can also use connectors and conditions to organize your geometry elements or add conditional behavior to your subassembly.

## Previewing and Verifying the Subassembly Behavior
 
To preview and verify the subassembly behavior, follow these steps:

1. In the Preview panel, click Refresh to see a graphical representation of your subassembly geometry based on the current property values.
2. To simulate how your subassembly behaves with different target values and conditions, use the Target Values panel to enter different values for input parameters or targets. Click Refresh again to see how your subassembly geometry changes accordingly.
3. To check for any errors or warnings in your subassembly project, click Validate on the menu bar. A message box will appear showing any issues that need to be fixed before importing your subassembly into Civil 3D.

## Importing a Subassembly into Civil 3D
 
To import a subassembly into Civil 3D, follow these steps:

1. In Subassembly Composer, click File > Save As to save your subassembly project as a PKT file.
2. In Civil 3D, open a drawing file where you want to use your subassembly.
3. In the Tool Palettes panel, right-click on any palette and select Import Subassemblies from PKT Files.
4. Browse to the location of your PKT file and select it. Click Open.
5. Your subassembly will appear in the tool palette under Imported Subassemblies. You can now insert it into a 8cf37b1e13
